# The multi-layer component problem

When building interactive UI we often find "UI extensions". What I mean is the use-case for secondary parts of a component that might look like they are connected visually, but are located in separated layers overlaying other parts of the DOM.

HTML offers some native elements with such behavior that just works (in most cases), like the `<select>` or the `<date>` form elements. However they are not styleable [yet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Styling_HTML_forms)*, and even if they were, they will probably never catch up to the needs of more complex custom UI.

So we create our own components, our custom widgets that we can pour any shape of data into, structure it and style as we like. Unfortunately it doesn't matter the library we pick to form them with, in the end our bundle of Javascript is translated into native HTML and there we find ourself with a problem.

## The problems with absolute/fixed

CSS gives us the [`position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) property, and for a moment it seems like it would solve all of our problems. Setting `absolute/fixed` position in CSS will cause an element to pop out of the document flow and take no space while making its position relative to an upper containing block (may it be the viewport or transformed parent element for `fixed` position or the first none `static` position parent for the `absolute` position).

While this can help us to position our parts in a way that seems to work for simple use cases, it is highly fragile and have some unexpected behaviors.

The main problem is the overflow trap, in which under certain conditions, the overflow of a parent element hides our extension no matter the position. See it happening [here](https://codepen.io/idoros/pen/XQZbar), and also you can notice that that absolute position box content is also squashed because it doesn't have a specified width.

### Static all the way

The only way I know to solve this issue today is to make sure every parent of our extension in set with `position: static`. That way our extension is relative to that upper parent, and also not affected by the overflow of in-between parents. You can check a solution like that in [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/popping-hidden-overflow/)

Unfortunately this is hard to achieve and easy to break, because any change that will cause a `static` parent element to create a new [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context) will break the trick.

And while this *might* be ok for documents, I wouldn't rely on this technic for generic components.

## What we have is custom layers

We can create custom layers through Javascript! May it be React [portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html), an equivalent idea in [Vue](https://linusborg.github.io/portal-vue/#/), [Angular](https://material.angular.io/cdk/portal/overview) or a custom implementation. 

The general idea is to generate an html element that overlays the application root, populate it with our extension markup and modify it with Javascript to be in the desired position and size. That works and seems to be the defacto solution for such cases today.

So what is the problem? We took our UI extension out of context! and this has unfortunate consequences to the features and behaviors that we expect from HTML.

Since our extension is no longer a decedent of our component our DOM is out of order and that causes the following issues:

- **Accessability** - The browser is no longer in control of our keyboard navigation. It simply cannot tell when one part of the DOM stops and another begins. We need Javascript to manage everything, and most implementations will probably miss many aspects of accessibility in ways that I'm pretty sure are not acceptable and will exclude many people.
- **Event propagation** - Events no longer propagate. We can make an ugly workaround and set listeners for EVERY type of event on our portal top wrapper element and then re-dispatch our event at the portal origin, but even then we will loose custom events unless our application specifically registers them.
- **Styling** - CSS selectors are basically broken across the portal boundary. Basic CSS that generates unique classes, like `.comp__root` for the root of our component and `.comp__item` for items within the portal will still work, but their relationship is severed. CSS states are no longer connected between the parts of our component. States that should be pure CSS are forced to move into Javascript in order to affect the DOM. This is especially bad for theming, because now we are unable to write selectors that connect component state to its parts (unless the component specifically tailored some state onto the part - and won't scale to parent component states)

The bottom line is that these compromises are making our components less generic because they are forced to "know" what is going to pass through the portal boundary ðŸ˜¢ 

## What I would like to see

The current situation is that even in 2019 we have no real solution for this problem, although we see this pattern EVERYWHERE. I believe that the result of this is a more hacky and less accessible web (without even talking about the amount of wasted dev time and performance issues).

One option is to go the way that the portal pattern is going and offer a way to "connect" an HTML element to another part of the DOM. However I could think of more then a few issues that would probably make the spec/implementation details way to complex.

A simpler approach would be to provide a primitive `display:pop`? value that would "raise" the content of whatever it holds into this top layer above everything and ignore any layout or overflow that it is located in. 

This leaves some question of what happened when multiple elements like that exist at the same time, or nested withing each other. We can achieve a nice default behavior and if we could listen with Javascript and provide a custom solution for managing queues and stacks of such layers.

There is another solution, that to be honest, I thought would be the solution and currently I'm very disappointed from. The `<dialog>` element. I'm not sure if its a bug or not, because the [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/interactive-elements.html#the-dialog-element) does talk about a "top-layer" that the dialog is opening in, however even in chrome/Opera where the dialog element is implemented, a parent overflow will cut the content of the dialog (see [here](https://codepen.io/idoros/pen/xeYxQW)).

I would imagine that the big thing that such a feature **should have** added is the ability to "pops out" into its own top layer and escapes the parent layer overflow!

We could then move it into place with Javascript. Libraries like [POPPER.JS](https://popper.js.org/) can help us with that. And with new APIs like the [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver) and [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) this will even get more performant over time.

Unfortunately it is also not well supported in other browsers yet. And while polyfilling most of the behavior is [possible](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill), we are still stuck with the overflow trap.

It is currently under a flag in **Firefox**, [no real movement](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84635) in **Webkit**, [under consideration](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/dialogelementformodals/?q=dialog) in **Edge** (at list this will be over soon) and will almost definitely never be supported in **Internet Explorer**.
